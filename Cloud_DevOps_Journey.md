# 🌩️ **Welcome to My Cloud DevOps Journey**

Hello and welcome! 👋 This repository is my personal space where I’ll document my Cloud and DevOps learning journey — covering everything from foundational concepts to hands-on projects.

## Roadmap for my Cloud & DevOps Journey

  A.) 🗒️ Weekly Notes: I’ll share key concepts, summaries, and insights from what I’ve learned each week.
